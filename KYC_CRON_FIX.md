# KYC Cron Job Fix - Multiple Execution Prevention

## Problem

The KYC Submitted Check cron job (`@Cron('0 9 * * *')`) was being triggered 4 times instead of once, causing duplicate admin notifications and log messages.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was likely caused by:

1. Multiple application instances running simultaneously
2. Hot reload issues during development
3. NestJS scheduler configuration problems
4. Lack of concurrent execution prevention

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Job Locking Mechanism

Added boolean flags to prevent concurrent execution of the same job within a single application instance:

```typescript
private isKYCSubmittedCheckRunning = false;
private isKYCReminderRunning = false;
private isKYCChangingReminderRunning = false;
private isReferralKYCNotificationRunning = false;
private isBirthdayNotificationRunning = false;
```

### 2. Enhanced Logging

Added detailed logging with:

- Process ID (PID) to identify which process is running
- Unique job IDs with timestamps
- Start and completion markers
- Better error tracking

### 3. Job Execution Flow

Each cron job now follows this pattern:

1. Check if job is already running
2. Set running flag to true
3. Execute job logic
4. Set running flag to false in finally block
5. Log completion

## Files Modified

- `src/users/services/user-kyc-cron.service.ts`

## Testing the Fix

### 1. Restart the Application

```bash
# Stop the current application
pkill -f "nest start"

# Start the application
yarn dev
```

### 2. Monitor Logs

Watch for the new log format:

```
[PID:5032][kyc-submitted-check-1745721600000] Starting KYC submitted check...
[PID:5032][kyc-submitted-check-1745721600000] Found X submitted KYC records
[PID:5032][1745721600000] KYC notifications sent to 7 admin users
[PID:5032][kyc-submitted-check-1745721600000] KYC submitted check completed successfully
```

### 3. Manual Testing

You can manually trigger the job to test:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/kyc-cron/trigger/kyc-submitted-check \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

### 4. Expected Behavior

- Only one execution should occur per scheduled time
- If a job is already running, subsequent attempts should be skipped with a warning log
- Each execution should have a unique job ID
- Process ID should remain consistent for the same application instance

## Verification Steps

1. **Check for Duplicate Executions**: Look for multiple "Starting KYC submitted check..." messages at the same time
2. **Verify Job IDs**: Each execution should have a unique job ID
3. **Check Process IDs**: All executions should have the same PID if running in a single instance
4. **Monitor Admin Notifications**: Should only receive one notification per scheduled time

## Future Improvements

If the issue persists, consider implementing:

1. **Database-Level Locking**: Create a `JobLock` table in Prisma schema for cross-instance locking
2. **Redis-Based Locking**: Use Redis for distributed locking across multiple application instances
3. **Job Queue System**: Implement a proper job queue system like Bull or Agenda
4. **Health Checks**: Add health check endpoints to monitor cron job status

## Monitoring

Add these log patterns to your monitoring system:

- `KYC submitted check is already running, skipping...`
- `KYC submitted check completed successfully`
- `Error in KYC submitted check:`

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, you can:

1. Remove the boolean flags
2. Revert to the original logging format
3. Keep the enhanced error handling

The fix is backward compatible and doesn't change the core functionality of the cron jobs.
